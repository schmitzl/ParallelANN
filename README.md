# A Parallel Implementation of the Training of a Backpropagation Multilayer Perceptron

This project has been created for the course <a href="https://www.kth.se/social/course/SF2568/">Parallel Computations for Large-Scale Problems</a>. We present an implementation and analysis of the node parallelized training of a fully connected backpropagation multilayer perceptron. The theoretical performance including speed up is calculated and compared to measured experimental speed up.
